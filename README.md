### Package Editor

The Package Editor is a simple editor window built using Odin Inspector, it allows for the quick updating of a package.json file without having to leave the editor.

The main two functions are allowing the incrementing of the package version using major, minor or patch increments and apply this to the package.json file. Secondly is the ability to publish a package directly from the editor without having to swap tp the command line or terminal.
